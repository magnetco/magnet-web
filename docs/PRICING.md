## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's included in the full-service retainer?

The retainer includes comprehensive coverage across all four phases of our methodology: Foundation (brand, messaging, website, conversion architecture), Activation (paid media, search marketing, content), Acceleration (landing pages, sales enablement, CRM automation), and Retention (lifecycle email, customer success, analytics). You get a dedicated team working on your growth every month.

### How does yearly billing work?

When you commit to yearly billing, you receive a 10% discount on the monthly rate. You can pay annually upfront or in quarterly installments. The commitment helps us plan resources and deliver more strategic, long-term work.

### Can I start with individual services and upgrade later?

Absolutely. Many clients start with a specific need—like branding or a new website—and later move to the full-service retainer as they see results. We'll credit a portion of your initial engagement toward your first retainer months.

### How long does it take to see results?

Results vary by service and market, but most clients see measurable improvements within 30-90 days. Search marketing and paid ads typically show faster initial results, while branding and website work compounds over time. We set clear expectations upfront.

### What if I need to pause or cancel?

The retainer is month-to-month with no long-term contracts. We ask for 30 days notice to wrap up active work and transition deliverables. For yearly commitments, we offer flexibility to pause for up to 2 months if business circumstances change.
