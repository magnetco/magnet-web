## What We Don't Do

To maintain quality and focus, we don't take on:

- **Pure development shops** — We build strategy-first, not code-first
- **Maintenance-only retainers** — We build systems, not patch existing ones
- **Template implementations** — Every project is custom to the client
- **Clients without budget authority** — We work with decision-makers
- **Quick-turnaround projects** — Good work takes appropriate time

---

## Engagement Minimums

| Service Type | Minimum Investment |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Full-Service Retainer | $25,000/month |
| Branding | From $25,000 |
| Websites | From $35,000 |
| Paid Media | From $8,000/month |
| Search Marketing | From $6,000/month |
