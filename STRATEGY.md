# STRATEGY.md

This document defines the strategic intent, constraints, and operating logic of this website.  
All copy, design, structure, code, and optimization decisions must align with what follows.

If something here is unclear, incomplete, or incorrect, this file is updated first.

## 1. Purpose

This website is not a brochure.

It is a revenue system designed to:
- Position Magnet as a senior, full-funnel growth partner
- Attract high-LTV B2B clients
- Convert qualified demand into booked strategy calls
- Support long-term compounding growth, not short-term spikes

Every page must earn its existence by advancing one of those outcomes.

## 2. Ideal Customer Profile

### Primary Audience

**Demographics:**
- CMOs, VPs of Marketing, and Marketing Directors
- Mid-market to enterprise B2B companies ($10M-$500M+ revenue)
- Established revenue streams, internal marketing teams (5-50+ people)
- Complex, multi-channel funnels requiring coordination
- Annual marketing budgets: $500K-$5M+

**Psychographics:**
- Frustrated by fragmentation across agencies, tools, and channels
- Experienced enough to recognize systemic problems
- Budget authority and decision-making power
- Under pressure to demonstrate ROI and efficiency
- Seeking strategic partnership, not tactical execution

**What they are NOT looking for:**
- Vendors who execute without understanding context
- Tactics without strategy
- Pretty websites that don't convert
- Agencies that add complexity
- Short-term fixes

**What they ARE looking for:**
- Coherence across all marketing activities
- Accountability and clear ownership
- A system that makes their job easier and safer
- Strategic thinking that translates to execution
- Long-term partnership

### Secondary Audience

- CEOs involved in growth decisions
- Heads of Revenue or Growth
- Founders transitioning from scrappy to scaled
- Board members evaluating marketing effectiveness

## 3. Core Problem We Solve

Most marketing organizations suffer from context loss.

Strategy lives in decks.  
Copy lives in docs.  
Design lives in Figma.  
SEO lives in spreadsheets.  
Performance lives in dashboards.  

No single system understands the whole.

This fragmentation leads to:
- Misaligned execution
- Wasted spend
- Slow iteration
- Political risk for the marketing leader

Magnet exists to eliminate that fragmentation by building unified digital systems where strategy, execution, and performance reinforce each other.

## 4. Magnet's Point of View

Websites are not pages.  
They are the center of gravity for modern growth.

A high-performance website should:
- Encode strategy
- Persuade across the full funnel
- Integrate seamlessly with paid, search, outbound, and analytics
- Improve over time through data and experimentation

If a website does not compound value, it is broken.

## 5. Our Approach

Magnet operates across four lifecycle phases:

Foundation  
Activation  
Acceleration  
Retention  

Each phase builds on the last.  
No phase can be skipped without consequences.

Foundation establishes clarity and structure.  
Activation drives qualified demand.  
Acceleration improves efficiency and conversion.  
Retention ensures the system compounds instead of decaying.

The website must clearly express this model and reinforce Magnet's role as the architect and operator of the system.

- Appropriate CTAs, not aggressive ones
- Natural progression through the funnel

Every CTA should feel appropriate, not aggressive.

## 8. Narrative Spine

The core story we tell:

**Act 1: The Problem (Context Loss)**
Marketing leaders are drowning in fragmentation. Strategy, copy, design, SEO, and performance live in separate systems. This creates misalignment, wasted spend, and political risk.

**Act 2: The Insight (Unified Systems)**
Websites are not pages—they are the center of gravity for modern growth. A high-performance website encodes strategy, persuades across the funnel, integrates with all channels, and compounds value over time.

**Act 3: The Solution (Magnet's Approach)**
Magnet builds unified digital systems where strategy, execution, and performance reinforce each other. We operate across four phases: Foundation, Activation, Acceleration, Retention. Each phase builds on the last.

**Act 4: The Outcome (Compounding Growth)**
Marketing leaders get coherence, accountability, and a system that makes their job easier and safer. The system compounds value instead of decaying.

Every page, every piece of content, every interaction should advance this narrative.

**Our unique position:**
We are the only agency that builds unified digital systems where strategy, execution, and performance reinforce each other. We don't just execute—we architect systems that compound value.

## 11. Messaging Principles

Our tone is:
- Clear, not clever
- Confident, not loud
- Direct, not salesy
- Strategic, not tactical

We speak to intelligent, experienced marketers.  
We do not over-explain basics.  
We do not hype trends.  
We do not hide behind jargon.

If a sentence could be written by any agency, it is rewritten.

## 12. Design Principles

Design exists to support comprehension and trust.

The interface should:
- Feel calm, deliberate, and senior
- Prioritize hierarchy and readability
- Reduce cognitive load
- Make the system feel inevitable, not flashy

Visual novelty is secondary to clarity.  
Every design decision should help the reader think.

## 13. SEO and Discoverability

Search is a compounding system, not a traffic trick.

We target:
- High-intent, problem-aware queries
- Long-tail, defensible topics
- Authority-building content clusters

SEO decisions must align with:
- Page intent
- Funnel stage
- Conversion logic

We do not create pages solely to rank.  
We create pages to persuade and convert.

## 14. Content Rules

All content must:
- Serve a clear intent
- Have a defined audience
- Advance the narrative
- Support conversion

We prefer:
- Fewer pages with more depth
- Structured content over freeform prose
- Reusability and consistency

Content is part of the system, not decoration.

## 15. Measurement and Feedback

Success is measured by:
- Qualified pipeline generated
- Conversion efficiency
- Lead quality
- Sales cycle impact
- Retention and expansion

Vanity metrics are ignored.

Data exists to inform decisions, not justify past ones.

## 16. Operating Constraints

This site must:
- Be fast
- Be accessible
- Be maintainable
- Be evolvable

We avoid:
- One-off solutions
- Hard-coded content
- Fragile layouts
- Unowned dependencies

If it cannot evolve, it does not ship.

## 17. Decision Authority

When tradeoffs arise:
- Strategy wins over aesthetics
- Clarity wins over novelty
- Systems win over assets
- Long-term leverage wins over short-term convenience

If there is disagreement, this document is the reference point.

## 18. Final Principle

This website is Magnet's best salesperson.

It should:
- Think clearly
- Speak honestly
- Demonstrate mastery
- Earn trust without asking for it

If the site does not make Magnet feel inevitable, it is unfinished.
