## The Four Phases

### Foundation

Establishes clarity and structure. No growth system works without it.

**Brand**

- Set the tone: precise, calm, direct, opinionated

**Messaging**

- Use plain, precise language
- Favor outcomes over features, structure over slogans

**Experience**

- Performance is non-negotiable

**Conversion**
- Map offers explicitly
- Design conversion paths intentionally
- Validate outcomes continuously

**Data**
- Track what changes decisions
- Focus on qualified conversion rate, cost per qualified lead, revenue per visitor
- Avoid metric sprawl
