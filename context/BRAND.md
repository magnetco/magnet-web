## Brand Character

Magnet shows up as **precise, calm, direct, and opinionated**.

We are confident without being loud.

## Voice Attributes

| Attribute | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Clear** | We say what we mean. No jargon, no hiding behind complexity. |
| **Confident** | We know our value. We don't hedge or apologize. |
| **Direct** | We get to the point. We respect the reader's time. |
| **Strategic** | We think in systems, not tactics. We see the whole picture. |

## Tone Principles

Our tone is:
- Clear, not clever
- Confident, not loud
- Direct, not salesy
- Strategic, not tactical

We speak to intelligent, experienced marketers. We do not over-explain basics. We do not hype trends. We do not hide behind jargon.

**If a sentence could be written by any agency, rewrite it.**

## What We Say

- Systems over tactics
- Revenue over vanity
- Clarity before scale
- Long-term partnership over short-term fixes
- Strategy embedded in execution
- Measurement from day one

## What We Don't Say

- Vague "full-service" claims
- AI theater or trend-chasing
- Buzzwords without substance
- Claims we can't support
- Anything that sounds like every other agency

## Messaging Hierarchy

When communicating value, prioritize in this order:

1. **System clarity** — We eliminate fragmentation
2. **Revenue impact** — We drive measurable outcomes
3. **Execution confidence** — We deliver what we promise
4. **Continuous optimization** — We compound value over time

## Language Rules

**Favor outcomes over features.**
- ❌ "We build websites"
- ✅ "We turn websites into revenue engines"

**Favor structure over slogans.**
- ❌ "Unlock your potential"
- ✅ "Foundation establishes clarity. Activation drives demand."

**Use plain, precise language.**
- ❌ "Leverage synergies across touchpoints"
- ✅ "Connect marketing, sales, and revenue"

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Traditional Agencies
We build systems, not campaigns. We encode strategy in code, not just decks.

### vs. Performance Marketing Agencies
We start with strategy, not tactics. We build for long-term, not just short-term wins.

### vs. Design/Dev Shops
We think strategically, not just aesthetically. We optimize for conversion and growth.

### vs. In-House Teams
We bring external perspective. We accelerate without adding headcount.

## Headline Patterns

Strong headlines are:
- Specific about the problem or outcome
- Short (under 10 words when possible)
- Active voice
- Benefit-oriented

Examples:
- "The website is the system"
- "Strategy that ships"
- "Revenue, not reports"

## CTA Language

CTAs should feel appropriate, not aggressive.

- ✅ "Book a strategy call"
- ✅ "See how it works"
- ✅ "Explore the method"
- ❌ "Get started NOW"
- ❌ "Don't miss out"
- ❌ "Limited time offer"

We optimize for lead quality over volume, confidence over urgency.
