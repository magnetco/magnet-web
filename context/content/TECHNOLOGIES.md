## Our Philosophy

**We choose tools based on the problem, not habit.** Every technology decision involves tradeoffs—we explain them and recommend what's right for your situation.

**We prefer modern, well-supported tools.** Maintainability matters. We avoid technologies that create long-term dependency or technical debt.

**We don't chase trends.** New isn't always better. We adopt tools when they've proven their value, not when they're trending on Twitter.
