# BSI Engineering
> Modernized the website for a Midwestern engineering leader

## Context

BSI Engineering, a respected civil and structural engineering firm in the Midwest, needed a website that reflected their technical expertise and project portfolio. Their existing site was dated and failed to communicate the depth of experience their team brings to complex engineering challenges.

For a professional services firm, the website is often the first impression—and BSI needed that impression to match their reputation in the engineering community.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience**

We focused on creating a clean, professional design that lets BSI's project work take center stage. The information architecture was restructured to help different prospect types—commercial developers, industrial clients, municipal agencies—find relevant examples quickly.

Key elements included:
- Portfolio organization by project type and sector
- Team expertise profiles highlighting credentials
- Mobile-responsive design for field reference
- Content management system for easy updates

## Outcome

The new website positions BSI as the established, capable engineering partner they are. The clean design and organized portfolio make it easy for prospects to find relevant project examples and understand BSI's capabilities.

## Testimonial

> "Gavin and his team did an amazing job with our site, they took the time to listen to our desires and worked tirelessly to bring them to life. We at BSI Engineering couldn't be happier with the result. A true professional team at a great value!"
