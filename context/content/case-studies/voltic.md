# Voltic
> Rebranded an automotive electrical division for the EV era

## Context

Voltic, a division of a NASDAQ-traded manufacturer, needed to reposition itself as the automotive industry shifted toward electrification. Their legacy brand imagery didn't resonate with modern, tech-savvy buyers or reflect the innovative electrical solutions they provide.

The challenge: create a brand identity and website that captures the energy of automotive electrification while communicating technical credibility to OEM partners and aftermarket customers.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Brand Architecture + Digital Experience**

We studied electrification trends across the automotive industry and analyzed how competitors positioned themselves. From this research, we developed a visual language that would feel contemporary without chasing trends.

The approach included:
- Color palette and typography that evoke energy and precision
- Imagery direction that showcases technical capability
- Design system built for flexibility across product lines
- Motion design that reinforces the brand's dynamic character

We built the site in Webflow for rapid deployment and rich animation capabilities—allowing us to create transitional effects that reinforce the brand's forward-looking positioning.

## Outcome

The rebranded website successfully positions Voltic as a contemporary, forward-thinking entity in the electrical manufacturing space. The design resonates with the modern automotive industry while maintaining the technical credibility required for OEM partnerships.

The new visual system extends beyond the website to trade show materials, product documentation, and sales collateral—creating a unified brand presence that supports Voltic's growth in the EV market.
