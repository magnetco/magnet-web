# O'Keeffe's
> Revitalized the digital presence for a household skincare brand

## Context

O'Keeffe's is a trusted name in working hands and feet skincare—the brand people reach for when they need serious relief. Their website needed to match the product's reputation: straightforward, effective, and trusted.

The challenge: create a digital experience that serves both consumers looking for product information and retail partners evaluating the brand.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We designed a site that communicates O'Keeffe's value proposition simply and directly—no fluff, just the information people need to solve their skincare problems. The design reflects the brand's practical, no-nonsense personality.

Key elements included:
- Product information optimized for decision-making
- Usage guides and skincare advice
- Retail partner resources
- Where-to-buy functionality
- Mobile-first design for in-store research

## Outcome

The refreshed website positions O'Keeffe's digital presence at the level of the brand's retail success. The straightforward design and clear information architecture help visitors find what they need quickly—whether they're learning about products or looking for a nearby retailer.
