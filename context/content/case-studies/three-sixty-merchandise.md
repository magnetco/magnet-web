# Three Sixty Merchandise
> Elevated a retail merchandising powerhouse's digital presence

## Context

Three Sixty Merchandise is an employee-owned retail merchandising company specializing in helping brands succeed within Kroger stores. Their depth of expertise—category management, space optimization, analytics, and retail execution—wasn't visible in their dated website.

As a company built on strategic retail expertise, they needed a digital presence that would communicate their unique value proposition and generate leads from brands looking to improve their Kroger performance.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We started with in-depth workshops to uncover Three Sixty's differentiators: their proximity and relationships with Kroger's leadership, their employee-ownership advantage, and their full-service approach to retail success.

The content strategy emphasized clarity and credibility, structuring the site so prospects could easily move from high-level capabilities to specific service details to contact.

Implementation included:
- Refined design aligned with their brand identity and retail leadership position
- Clear, conversion-focused page layouts
- Modular CMS collections for services, industries, and insights
- On-page SEO optimization
- Analytics and lead tracking setup

## Outcome

The redesigned website positions Three Sixty Merchandise as the go-to partner for brands navigating Kroger's competitive retail environment.

- **31% reduction** in blended customer acquisition cost
- **2.4x increase** in qualified inbound leads

Early engagement metrics show visitors spending more time on key service pages and submitting more inquiries—turning the website into a strategic growth asset.
