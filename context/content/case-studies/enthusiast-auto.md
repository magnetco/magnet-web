> Built a premium digital experience for Cincinnati's specialist BMW M-series dealer

## Context

Enthusiast Auto Group (EAG) is Cincinnati's leading specialist in rare and collectible BMW M-series vehicles. Their reputation for meticulous restoration and technical expertise is unmatched—but their website didn't reflect it.

The existing site failed to communicate the sophistication of their brand or the exceptional care they bring to every vehicle. Potential buyers looking at $80,000+ collector cars expect a digital experience that matches the product quality. EAG needed a website that would build trust before prospects ever walked through the door.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We immersed ourselves in EAG's world, spending time at their facility to understand their meticulous approach to vehicle restoration and sales. We interviewed their master technicians, sales team, and long-time clients to identify what matters most to collectors.

Key insight: potential buyers aren't just looking for vehicles—they're seeking assurance of authenticity, detailed documentation, and evidence of EAG's renowned attention to detail. Every design decision flowed from this understanding.

The interface echoes BMW's own design philosophy: refined, purposeful, and obsessively detailed. We built an inventory management system that showcases vehicles with the depth of information collectors expect.

## Outcome

Since launch, the new website has delivered measurable results:

- **47% increase** in qualified leads
- **35% increase** in average time spent on vehicle detail pages
- **68% improvement** in mobile user engagement
- **52% reduction** in bounce rate

The site now serves as EAG's most effective sales tool—building credibility and qualifying prospects before the first conversation.
