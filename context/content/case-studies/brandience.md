# Brandience
> Refreshed the digital presence for a full-service franchise marketing agency

## Context

Brandience is a Cincinnati-based advertising agency specializing in retail, restaurant, and franchise industries. Their existing website had grown stale and no longer reflected their creative capabilities or strategic depth.

They needed a refresh that would showcase their creative work while communicating their industry expertise—demonstrating to potential clients that Brandience understands the unique challenges of franchise and multi-location marketing.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience**

We worked closely with Brandience's leadership to understand their positioning and the outcomes they drive for clients. The design process focused on letting their work speak for itself while providing clear pathways for different prospect types.

The implementation included:
- Portfolio showcase optimized for visual impact
- Industry-specific landing pages for retail, restaurant, and franchise prospects
- Team profiles that build personal connection
- Case study templates that highlight measurable results

## Outcome

The refreshed website accurately represents Brandience's capabilities and creative approach. The site builds trust with prospects before the first sales conversation by demonstrating relevant experience in their specific industry vertical.

## Testimonial

> "We hired the Magnet agency to refresh the design of the website and inject creativity into the digital presence of the brand. We love the site and feel like it represents our company well. All of the going-in goals were achieved."

— **Brian McHale**, CEO
