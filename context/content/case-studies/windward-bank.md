# Windward Bank
> Built a cutting-edge digital banking platform for a century-old institution

## Context

Windward Bank, a community bank with over a century of history, needed to modernize their digital presence without losing the trust and relationships that define community banking. Their existing website didn't meet modern security standards or customer expectations for digital banking.

The challenge: create a platform that would feel contemporary and capable while honoring the institution's heritage and maintaining the personal touch their customers value.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We designed a banking platform that balances security, usability, and brand heritage. The implementation prioritized:

- Modern, secure architecture meeting banking compliance requirements
- Clear information hierarchy for banking products and services
- Location and team information that reinforces community presence
- Mobile-optimized experience for banking on the go
- Integration with core banking systems

The visual design references Windward's heritage while feeling thoroughly modern—demonstrating that a century of experience doesn't mean outdated technology.

## Outcome

The new platform positions Windward Bank for the next era of community banking. Customers get the digital experience they expect from modern banking while maintaining the personal relationships that make community banks valuable.
