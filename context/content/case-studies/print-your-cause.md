# Print Your Cause
> Rebuilt the sales website for a charitable printing company

## Context

Print Your Cause is a B Corp-certified printing company that donates a portion of profits to charitable causes chosen by their customers. Their mission is compelling, but their website wasn't communicating it effectively—or converting the visitors who found them.

They needed a site that would tell their story, explain their unique model, and make it easy for organizations to get quotes and place orders.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Brand Architecture + Digital Experience**

We worked with Print Your Cause to refine their messaging and visual identity before designing the new site. The goal was to lead with impact—showing potential customers how their print purchases contribute to causes they care about.

The implementation focused on:
- Mission-forward storytelling that differentiates from commodity printers
- Clear explanation of the charitable giving model
- Streamlined quote request process
- Portfolio showcasing quality and capabilities
- Customer testimonials and charity partner highlights

## Outcome

The new website effectively communicates what makes Print Your Cause different. Visitors quickly understand the value proposition and the site provides clear pathways to engage—whether requesting a quote, learning about charity partners, or exploring past projects.
