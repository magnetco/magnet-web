# Florence Y'alls
> Built a vibrant Jamstack website for a local baseball team

## Context

The Florence Y'alls, a popular independent baseball team in Northern Kentucky, needed a website that captured their fun, community-focused brand while handling the operational demands of a sports franchise: ticket sales, merchandise, game schedules, and real-time standings.

The challenge: create a platform that would engage fans, drive revenue, and be easy for the team's staff to update throughout a busy season.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We designed an experience that embodies the Y'alls' energetic personality while providing fans with everything they need—from buying tickets to checking standings to shopping for gear.

The Jamstack architecture delivers:
- Fast load times for game-day traffic spikes
- Integrated Shopify store for merchandise and tickets
- API integration for real-time division leaderboards
- Fully editable CMS with configurable components
- Mobile-first design for fans at the ballpark

## Outcome

The website captures the spirit of Florence Y'alls baseball—vibrant, fun, and community-oriented. The integrated systems make it easy for fans to engage with the team while giving staff the tools to keep content fresh throughout the season.

The platform strengthened the Y'alls' connection with their fanbase and streamlined the operational complexity of running a professional sports franchise.
