# Commercial Vehicle Group (CVG)
> Built seamless automotive ecommerce for a NASDAQ-traded corporation

## Context

Commercial Vehicle Group (CVG) is a publicly traded manufacturer of electrical systems, seating, and trim components for commercial vehicles. Their aftermarket parts division needed a modern ecommerce platform that could handle complex B2B transactions while serving individual customers.

The challenge: create a purchasing experience that works for fleet managers ordering in bulk, mechanics sourcing specific parts, and individual truck owners maintaining their vehicles—all within a system that integrates with CVG's enterprise backend.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We designed an ecommerce system that accommodates the diverse needs of commercial vehicle aftermarket buyers. The platform includes sophisticated search and filtering for technical specifications while maintaining simplicity for users who know exactly what they need.

Implementation included:
- Part number and vehicle compatibility search
- B2B account management and bulk ordering
- Integration with enterprise inventory systems
- Technical documentation and specification access
- Mobile-optimized experience for field purchasing

## Outcome

The platform successfully serves CVG's diverse customer base—from fleet operations managers placing large orders to individual owner-operators sourcing replacement parts. The integrated systems reduce order errors and support the company's aftermarket growth strategy.
