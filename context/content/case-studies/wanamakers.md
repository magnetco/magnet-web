# Wanamaker's
> Built a bespoke auction platform for a thoroughbred horse trading startup

## Context

Wanamaker's was founded to bring transparency and efficiency to thoroughbred horse trading through online auctions. The founders needed a platform that could handle the complexity of high-value live auctions while building trust with an industry accustomed to in-person sales.

The stakes were high: auction software must be absolutely reliable when bids are flying on horses worth tens of thousands of dollars. And the experience needed to feel appropriate for buyers and sellers accustomed to the traditions of thoroughbred racing.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We designed and built a custom auction platform from the ground up. The system handles:

- Real-time bidding with sub-second updates
- Buyer and seller account management
- Horse profiles with pedigree and performance data
- Payment processing and escrow
- Mobile experience for auction participation
- Admin tools for auction management

The visual design balances the digital efficiency of online auctions with the prestige and tradition of thoroughbred racing.

## Outcome

Wanamaker's launched with a platform capable of supporting their vision for modernizing thoroughbred trading. The system handles the technical complexity of live auctions while providing the trust and transparency that builds confidence in high-value transactions.
