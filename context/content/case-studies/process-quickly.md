# Process Quickly
> Built a therapeutic web application for emotional processing and CBT

## Context

Process Quickly was founded by a New York-based therapist who wanted to extend the reach of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) beyond traditional session formats. The vision: a web application that could guide users through personalized therapeutic exercises using art and structured reflection.

The challenge combined brand creation, product design, and technical development—building something that felt warm and approachable while delivering clinically-informed therapeutic value.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Brand Architecture + Digital Experience**

We began with extensive discovery to understand the therapeutic methodology and target user needs. This included reviewing clinical literature on CBT applications, interviewing potential users, and mapping the emotional journey the application would guide users through.

The design process was comprehensive:
- Research and storyboarding to map the therapeutic journey
- Mood boards establishing visual language that supports emotional openness
- Wireframes and user flows optimized for engagement without friction
- Brand identity that balances warmth with clinical credibility

We developed the full-stack application with careful attention to the micro-interactions that make therapeutic exercises feel supportive rather than clinical.

## Outcome

The web application successfully delivers on its therapeutic mission:

- Users report positive experiences with the guided exercises
- Increased customer retention compared to industry benchmarks
- Improved organic search rankings driving qualified traffic
- Positive feedback from mental health professionals on the clinical approach

The platform gives Process Quickly a foundation to scale their therapeutic approach while maintaining the personal, supportive experience that makes the methodology effective.
