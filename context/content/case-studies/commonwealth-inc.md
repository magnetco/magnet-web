# Commonwealth Inc
> Delivered 200% ROI within three days of website relaunch

## Context

Commonwealth Inc needed a website that could communicate their value proposition clearly and convert qualified prospects into sales conversations. Their previous site wasn't generating the lead quality or volume their growth required.

The stakes were high—Commonwealth needed a site that would work as a sales tool from day one.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We focused on clarity and conversion. Every page was designed with a specific user intent in mind, and every section moved visitors toward a clear next step. The messaging was sharpened to communicate value quickly and address common objections.

The implementation emphasized:
- Clear value proposition above the fold
- Structured content that answers key buyer questions
- Strategically placed conversion points
- Fast load times and mobile optimization
- Analytics setup for ongoing optimization

## Outcome

The results were immediate and measurable:

- **Major client signed within 3 days** of launch
- **200% ROI** on the entire website investment from that single deal
- The client specifically cited the new website as a key factor in their decision

The site continues to drive qualified leads, turning Commonwealth's web presence into a reliable revenue generator.

## Testimonial

> "We landed a major client just three days after launch. They mentioned the new website as a key factor—and that single lead already delivered a 200% ROI on the whole website project. Amazing work team Magnet."
