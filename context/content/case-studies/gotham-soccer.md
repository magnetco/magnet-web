# Gotham Soccer
> Built a multi-league recreational sports platform

## Context

Gotham Soccer operates recreational soccer leagues across multiple cities in the United States. Managing registrations, schedules, payments, and communications across leagues with thousands of players required a purpose-built platform—not cobbled-together tools.

They needed a system that could scale with their growth while making it easy for players to find leagues, register, and stay connected with their teams.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We conducted extensive research to understand the needs of Gotham's diverse user base: players looking for leagues, team captains managing rosters, and league administrators handling operations.

The platform was built with:
- Custom APIs handling complex data relationships (teams, players, schedules, results)
- Registration and payment processing
- Real-time schedule updates and results tracking
- Communication tools for league announcements
- Admin dashboard for league management
- Mobile-responsive design for on-field access

We used Agile methodologies to iterate rapidly, incorporating feedback from players and administrators throughout development.

## Outcome

The platform transformed Gotham Soccer's operations:

- Seamless registration and payment processing
- Automated scheduling and results tracking
- Improved communication between leagues and players
- Scalable foundation for geographic expansion

The system continues to evolve with ongoing feature development as Gotham Soccer expands to new markets.
