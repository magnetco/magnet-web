> Built annotation and assignment software for the humanities classroom

## Context

The UCLA English Department needed a custom annotation tool and content management system that would enhance how students engage with texts in humanities courses. The existing tools didn't support the kind of collaborative, contextual annotation that makes literary study come alive.

The challenge: build software that would integrate with UCLA's infrastructure while providing an intuitive experience for both students and instructors across multiple departments.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience (Custom Development)**

We began with extensive discovery to understand pedagogical goals and technical requirements. The platform needed to handle diverse use cases—from undergraduate survey courses to graduate seminars—while integrating with UCLA's authentication systems and cloud infrastructure.

The implementation included:
- Custom student-facing annotation interface
- Instructor content management backend
- Integration with UCLA's Shibboleth authentication
- Box.com integration for document management
- Scalable architecture for cross-department adoption

Our team worked closely with faculty throughout development, incorporating feedback to refine features and ensure the tool supported real classroom needs.

## Outcome

The UC Annotate Tool has been used by thousands of students across multiple departments at UCLA. The platform:

- Enhances student engagement with primary texts
- Supports collaborative annotation and discussion
- Integrates seamlessly with existing UCLA systems
- Provides instructors with flexible assignment tools

UCLA continues to develop the platform with plans to expand adoption across other UC campuses.

## Testimonial

> "Working with a bright, eager team, their passion for their work, and their passion for our work, was truly remarkable. Issues we thought that were intractable were solved with elegant and innovative design ideas. Integration with legacy systems proceeded much more smoothly than anyone anticipated. At every turn, their work was professional and exceptional."
