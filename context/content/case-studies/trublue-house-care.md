# TruBlue House Care
> Built a franchise website platform for a professional services company

## Context

TruBlue House Care is a franchise organization providing home maintenance and handyman services. They needed a scalable website platform that could serve their corporate needs while enabling franchisees to have local, customized presences.

The challenge: create a system that maintained brand consistency while allowing individual franchisees to highlight local services, team members, and service areas.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience**

We designed a platform architecture that balances central brand control with local flexibility. The system uses modern headless technologies—Netlify for deployment and Sanity.io for content management—to enable rapid updates and franchise expansion.

Key features included:
- Templated franchise site generation
- Local customization within brand guidelines
- Central content management for brand assets
- SEO-optimized local landing pages
- Fast, reliable hosting infrastructure

## Outcome

The platform supports TruBlue's franchise growth by making it easy to launch new franchise websites while maintaining brand consistency. The modern technology stack delivers fast load times and reliable performance—critical for a service business where customers often need help quickly.
