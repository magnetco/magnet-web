# Explore.org (Annenberg Foundation)
> Built a comprehensive live streaming platform for wildlife conservation

## Context

Explore.org is a philanthropic initiative funded by the Annenberg Foundation dedicated to raising awareness of animals and endangered native tribes worldwide. Their vision required sophisticated technology: live streaming feeds of animals in their natural habitats, processed and delivered to viewers around the world in real-time.

The challenge combined mission-driven storytelling with complex video infrastructure—creating an engaging platform that would inspire conservation awareness while handling the technical demands of continuous live streaming.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience (Custom Development)**

We worked closely with Explore.org's team to understand both their conservation mission and the technical requirements for reliable live streaming at scale. The platform needed to capture footage from remote locations, process video feeds through automated transformation scripts, and deliver smooth playback across devices.

The implementation included:
- Custom Python Django-based platform architecture
- Proprietary video processing software for live feeds
- Multiple microsites for different conservation initiatives
- Content management for educational materials
- Scalable infrastructure for traffic spikes during key wildlife events

## Outcome

The result was a robust platform that supports Explore.org's conservation mission:

- Live streaming of wildlife across multiple global locations
- Educational content that connects viewers with conservation efforts
- Reliable infrastructure handling millions of viewers
- Ongoing engineering partnership for platform evolution

Our multi-year collaboration with Explore.org continues to expand the platform's capabilities as new conservation initiatives launch.
