# Board Game Tables
> Built an engaging ecommerce experience for a premium gaming furniture company

## Context

Board Game Tables sells high-end custom gaming furniture to a passionate, detail-oriented audience. Tabletop gaming enthusiasts research extensively before making four-figure purchases—they want to understand construction quality, customization options, and the experience of owning the product.

The company needed an ecommerce platform that could handle complex product configurations while telling the story that justifies premium pricing.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We designed a shopping experience that mirrors the consideration process of high-value furniture purchases. Rather than rushing users to checkout, we built discovery paths that let customers explore construction details, watch assembly videos, and configure their ideal table.

Key features included:
- Visual product configurator for custom options
- Deep-dive content on materials and craftsmanship
- Customer gallery showcasing tables in real gaming spaces
- Integrated financing options for premium purchases

## Outcome

The platform successfully converts enthusiast interest into purchases by providing the depth of information serious buyers need. The configurator reduces friction in the customization process, while rich content builds the confidence required for premium furniture purchases.

The site serves as both a sales tool and a community hub—featuring customer stories and gaming setups that reinforce the lifestyle Board Game Tables enables.
