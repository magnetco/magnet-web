# Bendu Academy
> Created a membership-integrated website for a startup BJJ gym

## Context

Bendu Academy, a startup Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym, needed more than a marketing website—they needed a platform that would drive memberships, manage class schedules, and build community from day one.

As a new gym entering a competitive market, they required a digital presence that would communicate their unique approach to martial arts training while handling the operational complexity of membership management and class booking.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience + Conversion Architecture**

We designed a platform that serves multiple purposes: attracting new students through compelling content, converting visitors into trial members, and supporting ongoing engagement for existing students.

The implementation included:
- Integrated membership and payment system
- Class scheduling and booking functionality
- Instructor profiles and belt progression tracking
- Mobile-optimized design for on-the-go access
- Content management system for updates and announcements

The visual design captures the energy and discipline of BJJ while remaining approachable to beginners considering their first class.

## Outcome

The website serves as Bendu Academy's operational backbone—handling member management, driving new student acquisition, and building the digital community that extends the gym's culture beyond the mat.

The integrated systems eliminated the need for multiple tools and manual processes, allowing the gym to focus on training while the website handles administrative complexity.
