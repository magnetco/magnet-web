# Luxottica Foundation
> Built an eyesight charity foundation website for a global eyewear brand

## Context

Luxottica, the world's largest eyewear company, operates OneSight—a charitable foundation dedicated to providing vision care to underserved communities globally. They needed a website that would communicate the foundation's mission, engage donors, and share the impact of their work around the world.

The challenge: create a compelling digital experience that would inspire action while handling the operational needs of a global nonprofit.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience**

We designed an experience that leads with impact—showing visitors the tangible difference OneSight makes in communities worldwide. The storytelling approach balances emotional connection with the credibility that comes from scale and measurement.

The implementation included:
- Impact visualization and storytelling
- Donation pathways optimized for conversion
- Event and campaign landing pages
- Volunteer opportunity integration
- Multilingual support for global reach

## Outcome

The website successfully communicates OneSight's mission and drives engagement with donors and volunteers. The impact-focused design helps visitors understand the scale and effectiveness of the foundation's work, building confidence in their contributions.
