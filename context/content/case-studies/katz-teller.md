# Katz Teller
> Refreshed the digital presence for an established Cincinnati law firm

## Context

Katz Teller is a well-established Cincinnati law firm with a strong reputation built over decades of practice. Their website, however, hadn't kept pace with their growth or their clients' expectations.

For law firms, the website is often the first touchpoint with potential clients during a stressful time. It needs to communicate competence, trustworthiness, and approachability—while helping visitors find the right attorney for their specific legal needs.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience**

We designed a site that balances the gravitas appropriate to legal services with the warmth that helps clients feel comfortable reaching out. The information architecture makes it easy for visitors to understand the firm's practice areas and find attorneys with relevant experience.

Key elements included:
- Clear practice area organization
- Attorney profiles that build trust and connection
- Case result highlights (where appropriate)
- Mobile-optimized design for on-the-go research
- Contact pathways optimized for conversion

## Outcome

The refreshed website accurately represents Katz Teller's capabilities while making it easy for potential clients to take the next step. The clean, professional design builds credibility while the improved user experience reduces friction in the client acquisition process.

The site serves as a foundation for the firm's ongoing digital marketing efforts, supporting both organic search and paid campaigns.
