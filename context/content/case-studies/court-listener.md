# CourtListener
> Modernized the interface for America's largest open legal research platform

## Context

CourtListener, operated by the Free Law Project, needed to modernize their legal research platform serving millions of legal opinions across 421 jurisdictions. The platform is used daily by lawyers, journalists, academics, and researchers who depend on reliable, efficient access to case law.

The existing interface had grown dated and created friction in research workflows. Users struggled with complex navigation patterns that slowed their work. CourtListener needed a complete UX overhaul that would improve engagement and research efficiency without disrupting the robust functionality their users relied on.

## Approach

**Phase: Foundation → Digital Experience**

We began with an extensive discovery phase, analyzing user behavior patterns and conducting stakeholder interviews to understand the diverse needs of CourtListener's user base. We mapped out complex user journeys for different personas—legal professionals conducting case research, journalists investigating court records, and academics analyzing legal trends.

The design process focused on:
- Streamlining the search interface for efficient legal research
- Developing intuitive navigation patterns for complex legal hierarchies
- Creating clear visual systems for displaying case relationships and citations
- Building accessible interfaces that comply with legal industry standards

## Outcome

The redesigned platform transformed CourtListener's ability to serve its mission of open legal research:

- **20% increase** in average session duration
- **40% faster** average page load times
- Enhanced accessibility compliance
- Improved user satisfaction among legal professionals and researchers

The new interface reduces cognitive load while handling the complexity inherent in legal research, allowing users to find relevant case law faster and understand jurisdictional relationships at a glance.
