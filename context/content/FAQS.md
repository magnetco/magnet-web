# Frequently Asked Questions

Straight answers to common questions about working with Magnet.

---

## Working With Us

### How do you determine if we're a good fit?

We start with a conversation about your goals, timeline, and budget. Not every project is right for us, and we'd rather know that early. We're looking for clients who value strategic thinking, have realistic expectations, and are ready to be collaborative partners.

### Can Magnet partner with agencies already working with us?

Yes—collaboration is core to our approach. We work alongside your existing agencies, complementing their efforts while maintaining clear scope boundaries. We've partnered successfully with PR firms, creative agencies, and media buyers.

### Do you customize strategies for different industries?

Every strategy is tailored to your market, audience, goals, and team. We don't use templates or rinse-and-repeat approaches. Your business is unique, and your strategy should be too.

### How do you measure success?

We focus on business outcomes, not vanity metrics. That means tracking qualified leads, conversions, revenue impact, and growth—not just traffic or impressions. We establish clear KPIs upfront and report against them.

### Do you integrate with our existing marketing tools?

Yes. We work with whatever systems you have—HubSpot, Salesforce, GA4, custom dashboards, and most major martech platforms. Our goal is to enhance your existing capabilities, not replace them.

## Website & Development

### Can we edit content on our own website?

Absolutely. We believe you should be able to update your own content. We build with content management systems that give you control over text, images, and pages while constraining layout changes to maintain design integrity.

### How do you ensure our website fits with our brand?

We begin by immersing ourselves in your brand—understanding your personality, tone, and visual identity. This informs every design decision. If you have brand guidelines, we follow them. If you don't, we can help create them.

### How do you handle website maintenance and support?

We offer ongoing support retainers for clients who need regular updates, security monitoring, and technical assistance. For project-based work, we include a warranty period and provide documentation for long-term maintenance.

### What technologies do you use?

We choose technologies based on your specific needs. Common platforms include Next.js for complex applications, Webflow for marketing sites, Sanity for content management, and Shopify for ecommerce. See our [Technologies](/context/content/TECHNOLOGIES.md) page for details.

### How does site speed impact conversion rates?

For every second delay in page load time, conversion rates drop by approximately 4.42%. Faster sites create better first impressions, reduce bounce rates, and improve SEO rankings. We prioritize performance in every build.

## SEO & Search Marketing

### Do you offer technical SEO audits before starting a project?

Yes. We provide comprehensive technical SEO audits both as standalone services and as the initial phase of broader optimization projects. The audit identifies issues and prioritizes fixes based on impact.

### Can on-page SEO benefit established websites, or only new launches?

On-page SEO delivers substantial benefits for both. Established sites often have more opportunities—legacy content to optimize, internal linking to improve, and technical debt to address. New sites benefit from getting it right from the start.

### How do you acquire high-quality backlinks?

We earn authoritative links through value-centric methods: creating genuinely useful content, digital PR, strategic partnerships, and relationship-based outreach. We don't buy links or use tactics that risk penalties.

### What is AI search optimization, and should we care about it?

Generative AI optimization prepares your content for AI-powered search engines that deliver synthesized responses. As more users interact with AI search tools, optimizing for these platforms becomes increasingly important for visibility.

### How do you determine if our business is ready for international SEO?

Businesses with strong domestic SEO performance, proven international interest (traffic, inquiries, sales from other countries), and operational capacity to serve global customers are typically ready. We assess readiness as part of our discovery process.

## Paid Media & PPC

### Do you offer PPC strategy or just execution?

Both. We develop full-funnel PPC strategies—audience targeting, messaging, bidding strategies, testing frameworks—and handle the day-to-day execution and optimization.

### Can you integrate PPC efforts with our broader marketing strategy?

Yes. Our PPC campaigns align with your branding, creative direction, CRM workflows, and revenue goals. We coordinate with your other marketing activities to maximize impact and avoid redundancy.

### Can you manage large-scale paid media budgets across multiple channels?

We work with companies running six- and seven-figure PPC budgets across Google, Meta, LinkedIn, and other platforms. Our team is equipped to manage complex, multi-channel campaigns with sophisticated attribution.

### How do you handle underperforming campaigns?

We implement a structured diagnostic process: analyzing data, identifying issues, testing hypotheses, and implementing changes. Underperforming campaigns get attention, not excuses. We provide clear reporting on what we tried and what we learned.

### How do you measure the success of a PPC campaign?

We focus on business-critical metrics: cost per lead, ROAS, conversion rates, and customer lifetime value. All campaigns come with transparent reporting tied to the KPIs that matter for your business.

## Social Media & Content

### Do you create all the content?

For comprehensive social engagements, yes—from visuals and copy to scheduling. We handle end-to-end content creation tailored to your brand voice and audience. For other arrangements, we can supplement your internal team.

### Can you manage both organic and paid social campaigns?

Yes. We specialize in blending organic content with precision-targeted paid campaigns to maximize reach, engagement, and conversion across platforms.

## AI & Technology

### Does Magnet work with AI technologies?

We incorporate AI tools where they add value: development copilots, content assistance, image generation, and campaign optimization. We're practical about AI—using it to enhance quality and efficiency, not as a gimmick.

### How do AI chatbots integrate with existing CRM and marketing systems?

Modern AI chatbots connect to your tech stack through secure APIs, allowing bidirectional data flow. They can personalize interactions based on CRM data and update customer records based on conversations.

### How do you prevent AI chatbots from providing incorrect information?

Through comprehensive training, content guardrails, and continuous monitoring. We implement fallback mechanisms that connect customers with human agents when the bot reaches confidence limits.

## Ecommerce

### Do I need to rebuild my entire store to improve speed?

Not necessarily. While some stores benefit from rebuilding with a performance-first approach, we often achieve significant gains through targeted optimization: image compression, code cleanup, app audits, and hosting improvements.

### How does Shopify's native speed score relate to actual performance?

Shopify's speed score provides a useful benchmark but doesn't tell the complete story. We focus on real-user metrics and Core Web Vitals that directly impact user experience and conversion rates.

## Strategy & Planning

### Can growth marketing work for established brands?

Absolutely. Growth marketing isn't just for startups—it helps established brands uncover new channels, accelerate results, and outmaneuver slower competitors. The experimentation mindset applies regardless of company size.

### How do you ensure global content remains brand-consistent but locally relevant?

We implement a "global framework, local adaptation" approach: creating core messaging templates that maintain brand consistency while allowing regional teams to adapt for cultural nuances and local market conditions.
