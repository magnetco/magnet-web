## What Magnet Is

Magnet is a growth architecture firm. We design high-performance websites and the systems behind them so marketing, sales, and revenue work together as a single engine.

We are not:
- A design agency
- A development shop
- A content mill
- A performance marketing agency
- A generalist consultancy

We are a strategic partner that builds unified digital systems where strategy, execution, and performance reinforce each other.

## The Problem We Solve

Most marketing organizations suffer from context loss.

Strategy lives in decks. Copy lives in docs. Design lives in Figma. SEO lives in spreadsheets. Performance lives in dashboards. No single system understands the whole.

This fragmentation leads to:
- Misaligned execution
- Wasted spend
- Slow iteration
- Political risk for the marketing leader

Magnet eliminates that fragmentation by building unified digital systems where strategy, execution, and performance reinforce each other.

## Who We Serve

### Primary Audience

**CMOs, VPs of Marketing, and Marketing Directors** at mid-market to enterprise B2B companies ($10M–$500M+ revenue).

They have:
- Established revenue streams
- Internal marketing teams (5–50+ people)
- Complex, multi-channel funnels
- Annual marketing budgets: $500K–$5M+
- Decision-making power and budget authority

They feel:
- Frustrated by fragmentation across agencies, tools, and channels
- Under pressure to demonstrate ROI and efficiency
- Seeking strategic partnership, not tactical execution

### Secondary Audience

- CEOs involved in growth decisions
- Heads of Revenue or Growth
- Founders transitioning from scrappy to scaled
- Board members evaluating marketing effectiveness

## Our Approach: Four Lifecycle Phases

Magnet operates across four phases. Each builds on the last. No phase can be skipped.

### Foundation
Establishes clarity and structure. Includes brand, messaging, experience design, conversion mapping, and measurement setup.

### Activation
Drives qualified demand. Includes paid media, social content, search marketing, creative storytelling, and partnerships.

### Acceleration
Improves efficiency and conversion. Includes landing experiences, offers, sales enablement, CRM automation, and attribution.

### Retention
Ensures the system compounds. Includes lifecycle marketing, predictive retention, feedback loops, community, and customer success.

## Core Beliefs

**Websites are not pages.** They are the center of gravity for modern growth.

A high-performance website should:
- Encode strategy
- Persuade across the full funnel
- Integrate with paid, search, outbound, and analytics
- Improve over time through data and experimentation

**If a website does not compound value, it is broken.**

## What Success Looks Like

- Qualified pipeline generated
- Conversion efficiency improved
- Lead quality increased
- Sales cycle shortened
- Retention and expansion grown

Vanity metrics (traffic, impressions, engagement) are inputs—not outcomes.

## This Website's Purpose

This website is Magnet's best salesperson. It is a revenue system designed to:

1. Position Magnet as a senior, full-funnel growth partner
2. Attract high-LTV B2B clients
3. Convert qualified demand into booked strategy calls
4. Support long-term compounding growth

Every page must earn its existence by advancing one of those outcomes.

The primary conversion action is **booking a strategy call**. Secondary conversions include engaging with methodology content, exploring service pages, and subscribing to insights.
