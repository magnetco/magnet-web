            Communities should create value for members and strengthen brand relationships, not just host discussions. Most 
            communities feel empty because they&apos;re built as forums instead of systems that provide resources and facilitate 
            connections. When community systems create value for members and align with brand values, they turn customers into 
            advocates and become powerful retention tools that compound over time.

              advocates who refer others. Our retention rates have improved dramatically.
