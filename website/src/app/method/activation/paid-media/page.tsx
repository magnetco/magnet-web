            Paid media should scale confidence, not anxiety. Paid media drives results, but it often feels fragile. Performance 
            swings, creeping costs, and the constant need to intervene. The issue isn't platforms or spend—it's that paid 
            media is often run as isolated campaigns instead of a system for stability, learning, and scale. When paid media 
            is structured correctly, it becomes predictable and scalable.

                  Every channel has a role in your funnel. We map channel strategy to funnel roles, ensuring each platform 
                  serves a specific purpose in moving prospects from awareness to action. This strategic approach means you're 
                  not just running ads—you're building a system where each channel complements the others. When channels are 
                  mapped to funnel roles, you understand what's working, why, and how far you can push it. Scaling happens 
                  only when efficiency holds, and this mapping ensures efficiency at every stage.
